## Overview

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house prices. The model is wrapped in a Flask web application that accepts user input through an HTML form. Users can input various features of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The application then processes this input and provides a predicted house price.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: A user-friendly HTML form to input house features.
- **Flask Backend**: A Flask web application to handle requests and serve predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained machine learning model to predict house prices based on input features.
- **Web Hosting**: Easily host the application on a web server.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```sh
